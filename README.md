Innovative Approach: Developed a novel method combining a Siamese neural network with a random forest classifier to predict strokes, marking the first integration of these technologies.
Class Imbalance Solution: Utilized SMOTE to address class imbalance, ensuring accurate predictions despite the lower number of stroke cases compared to healthy patients.
Superior Performance: The proposed approach outperformed five well-known machine learning algorithms, demonstrating its effectiveness in early stroke detection.
